# Automation Risk for Arizona's Transportation Jobs
Luyu Du | NYU Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service | July 2022

## Project Summary
### Primary research question:   
  As of 2021, how is automation threatening Arizona’s jobs in the transportation sector?   
### Additional research questions:  
1. What are the percentages of transportation jobs that are at high, medium, and low automation risks?  
2. Within the transportation industry, who is more likely to be impacted by automation (sex, race and ethnicity, age, education, and annual median wage)?   

## Data Summary
1. *Frey, C. B., & Osborne, M. A. (2013).* The data on automation probabilities is derived from a well-known study by two researchers at Oxford, Frey and Osborne, titled “The Future of Employment: How Susceptible are Jobs to Computerisation?” https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/The_Future_of_Employment.pdf  
2. *Current Population Survey (CPS) (2021).* CPS is a monthly survey of households conducted by the U.S. Bureau of Census, which provides a comprehensive body of data on demographic characteristics. 
- I used the CPS extracts from *Economic Policy Institute (EPI).* EPI provides useful data library code that processes raw CPS data for research purposes. Specifically, I will use the CPS 2021 data to analyze the demographic characteristics of Arizona’s transportation workers, including sex, race and ethnicity, age, and education. https://microdata.epi.org/sources/   
3. *U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (2021).* Major occupational group/Industry and annual median wage data for Arizona is from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_az.htm
